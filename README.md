# Update /!\
This new "Retextured" branch is no longer a fork of Beta Continuum or other resource packs, it's based on it's own core resource pack, and it's cross compatible with Minecraft 1.20 and above.

The purpose of this new branch is to restart the development with a more stable resource pack that works across all versions mentioned.

# Classic Reimagined Install Guide for 1.20 and newer
You can download Classic Reimagined from both [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/classic-reimagined-10s) and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/classic-reimagined), the way to install it is pretty simple, you must download both the resource pack and the [dependency pack](https://modrinth.com/project/ULU4JTr0), if you're using OptiFine, make sure you've downloaded the mod [here](https://optifine.net), and make sure it's up to date to run the latest features from this resource pack.
